For example, is it classification or regression, or some other higher-order problem type? It involves collecting the data that is believed to be useful in making a prediction and clearly defining the form that the prediction will take. It may also involve talking to project stakeholders and other people with deep expertise in the domain. This step also involves taking a close look at the data, as well as perhaps exploring the data using summary statistics and data visualization."

This involves tasks such as selecting a performance metric for evaluating the skill of a model, establishing a baseline or floor in performance to which all model evaluations can be compared, and a resampling technique for splitting the data into training and test sets to simulate how the final model will be used."

It may also involve summarizing the performance of the model in a standard way for project stakeholders, which is an important step."
